    #  This example shows additional details about how to work with certificates in Azure key vaults
    #  Note: When a Key Vault certificate is created, an addressable key and secret are also created with the same name.
    #        The Key Vault key allows key operations and the Key Vault secret allows retrieval of the certificate value
    #        as a secret. A Key Vault certificate also contains public x509 certificate metadata.
    #  The following assumes that a key vault _certificate_ object named "my-cert" exists in the key vault
    #  'defaultValues' are used for tenant id, client id and name of key vault
    # kvWithCert:
    #
    #   # Obtain the certificate
    #   # Note: For chain of certificates, using object type cert only returns the Server certificate and not the entire chain.
    #   certs:
    #     - nameInKv: my-cert
    #       mountAsEnv: "name.of.env.variable.holding.my-cert.in.pem.format"
    #
    #   # Obtain the public key: the public key is stored in a Key Vault key, we can retrieve it by using object type key
    #   keys:
    #     - nameInKv: my-cert
    #       mountAsEnv: "name.of.env.variable.holding.public.key.of.my-cert.in.pem.format"
    #
    #   # Obtain the private key and certificate
    #   # the private key is stored in a Key Vault secret with the public certificate included, it can be retrieve by using object type secret
    #   # Note: For chain of certificates, using object type secret returns entire certificate chain along with the private key.
    #   secrets:
    #     - nameInKv: my-cert
    #       mountAsEnv: "name.of.env.variable.holding.private.key.and.entire.chain.of.my-cert.in.pem.format"
    #     # Secrets also supports two additional parameters to help with mounting certificates in containers
    #     #  fileMountFormat - default is "pem",    must be one of ["pem", "pfx"]
    #     #  secretEncoding  - default is "utf-8",  must be one of ["utf-8", "hex", "base64"]
    #     # Here is how to mount the entire certificate chain along with the private key in binary pfx format:
    #     - nameInKv: my-cert
    #       fileMountFormat: pfx
    #       secretEncoding: base64
    #       fileMountPath: "/path/of/my-cert.pfx"
